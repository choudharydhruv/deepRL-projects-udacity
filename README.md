This repository implements solutions for all the projects in the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

# Project 1: Navigation

![Trained Agent][image1]

For this project, we will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

# Project 2: Continous Control

![Trained Agent][image2]

For this environment we will train a multi-jointed arm that tracks a spherical ball
